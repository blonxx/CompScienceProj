                <p1>The first step I took in completing this assignment was setting out and researching retro games that would fit the criteria of the project. While researching I took multiple factors into consideration, the game has to have single player and multiplayer functions, it has to have 3 or more inputs, the game must also have some sort of points system and come to an end, while at the same time being completely random.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some of the games I looked into :
                    <br><br>
                    Pac-Man seemed interesting at first but there would be no clear way to implement a multiplayer feature as the game mainly focuses on single player. Random maps could be generated and the ghost movement could also be random but I decided that it wasn’t the right choice.
                    <br><br>
                    Tetris while fun also had flaws, like Pac-Man the game is single player and while multiplayer elements could be added it would be difficult to make everything work. The shapes dropping in different orders could make the game random but this also wasn’t the best choice.
                    <br><br>
                    After taking all of those factors into consideration I came to the conclusion that pong would be the best overall game to create, the game is relatively simple, it can be played in both single and multiplayer, it would be possible to introduce random elements to the physics of the ball. The game also features a point system and the game ends when the player fails to block the ball.
                    <br><br>
                    After choosing the game, I decided to putt a twist on the game to make it more interesting for the player. The change I made is the paddle decreasing in size the higher the players score is. This would make the game more difficult for players and the game would become more competitive and tense in multiplayer.
                    <br><br>
                    In conclusion I will recreate pong, the game will feature both multiplayer and single player modes, there will be a point system where the socore is logged to a database at the end of the game. The game will end if the ball hits one of the walls behind the paddles, and the game will get progressively harder as the player progresses. With all of these point outlined I proceeded to design the game.
                    <br><br>
                    I used the following resources to aid me with the completion of this assignment:

                    After conducting my research and establishing what game I will be making, I set more specifications for the project myself. Upon launch the user will be greeted with a main menu ui, prompted with a couple of options. These options consist of the rest of my specifications, Single player, Multiplayer, Scoreboard and a Quit button. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then I decided to design and code the game in python, more about this will be mentioned in the Implementation.
                    <br><br>
                    Below is the flowchart I created to help me visualise everything that needs to be accounted for :

                    <br><br>
                    I incorporated abstraction into my project by using various libraries like numpy, matplotlib.pyplot and firebase. By using numpy and Matplotlib.pyplot creating graphs and calculating mode median mean and frequency easier for me.
                    <br><br>
                    The model of my game relied on the speed of the game increasing as the player score is divisible by 5. This means the game will get progressively harder as the player progresses. This feature was presented in a pong commercial in 1976, the original game speed was changed with an analog dial, my game alters the speed automatically depending on the player score.

                <p1>
                    My project has been designed around the pygame library as it is a powerful and offers several useful tools. I decided to place various parts of the game into separate definitions in order to make it easier to call them at a later point. This opens the option of having multiple game modes for example multiplayer and single player as each segments are stored in separate definitions and loops, meaning they won’t interrupt each other.
                    <br><br>
                    I have used Firebase Realtime Database in my project, it allows me to send data like high scores and player names into a database. These entries are later called on and used to be displayed on scoreboards and calculate useful insights like mean median etc. 
                    <br><br>
                    Using Realtime Database also enables me to feature a scoreboard on the website as all the results are updated in realtime ensuring everything is perfectly in sync.
                    <br><br>
                    Bellow I have provided an algorithm from my game that was crutial to its function : 
                    <br><br>
                    scorelist = []
                    <br><br>
                    ref2 = db.reference('test')<br>
                    snapshot = ref2.order_by_value().limit_to_last(5).get()<br>
                    for key, val in snapshot.items():<br>
                    scorelist.append("{0}".format(key))<br>
                    scorelist.append("{0}".format(val))<br><br>
                    This snippet of code is crucial for the functionality of the database, as the values returned directly from firebase weren’t in a conventional python list meaning specific values can’t be extracted individually using an index.
                    <br><br>
                    The code starts off with the creation of a standard python list.<br>
                    Next we define the location of our firebase database.<br>
                    The next definition uses the location of the database and passes through some more information specifying what we want exactly, in this case we are ordering all the items by value and telling it to get the top 5 results.<br>
                    After that we add a player name (key) and the score (val) to the python list for every key and val in our firebase database.<br>
                    Using this code it is now possible to call a specific index and retrieve specific data from the list.<br><br>
                    The most major issue I’ve faced during this project was implementing the firebase realtime database. The resources online where scarce for implementing it into python. After a lot of research and trail and error I managed to find libraries that offer more or less what I need, after installing them I was faced with the challenge of navigating and setting up the google cloud IAM & admin. Another issue occurred when I was convinced I had to create a new principal in the permission group and grant access manually, as it turned out later a principal was created by firebase and was ready to go.<br>

                    I tested my game every time I added a new feature or line of code to make sure everything is still in order. This also made it easier to troubleshoot it in the future as if the game refused to run or if some sort of issue occurred it’d be easier for me to narrow because I was already working on that section of code.
                    <br><br>
                    The main portion of my code was tested by removing the lines of code that caused the game to end, therefore I was able to run the game continuously and could monitor the results that where being sent to the database.
                    <br><br>
                    Another method I used consisted of adding print lines in sections that where causing problems so I could narrow down what exactly is causing the issue depending on if the message prints or not

                    Some of the issues I discovered while testing where; The game ending as soon as it was started for the seccond time, this issue was caused by pygame.init() because the pygame was initilised only once at the start of the code the game was still in theory running after it ended. This issue was solved by initilising pygame at the start of every definition meaning a new game would start everytime the definiton is called.

                <p1>
                    In conclusion, I have achieved all of the goals I have set out in the investigation and design of this project. Upon starting the game the user is greeted with an interactive main menu, there is multiplayer and single player game modes, I also added a scoreboard that displays both player name and score of the top 5 players. This data is fetched from the firebase realtime database, There is also a statistics python script that I wrote. The script takes all the scores from the database and generates a graph displaying the mean median mode and frequency. 
                    <br><br>
                    If I was to do this project again I would choose javascript over python as javascript offers a similar library as pygame called kaboom. Using javascript would offer me more flexibility and an opportunity to incorporate my game into the html website. Another thing Id like to improve is the optimisation of my game, making it more efficient and overall work better.
                    <br><br>
                    One issue I faced while coding the game was that I wasn't able to alter the length of the paddles upon a score change. Therfore I decided to settle on changing the time variable increasing the speed of the game. Another issue was implementing a scoreboard into the website, the firebase documentation for javascript was fairly limited and didnt explain much, this caused many issues when I attempted to retrieve any value or key from the database. When unable to get any reasonable data from the database I decided to abandon the whole idea and remove it, I wish I would have been able to make it work.
