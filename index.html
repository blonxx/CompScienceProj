                <p1>The first step I took in completing this assignment was setting out and researching retro games that would fit the criteria of the project. While researching I took multiple factors into consideration, the game has to have single player and multiplayer functions, it has to have 3 or more inputs, the game must also have some sort of points system and come to an end, while at the same time being completely random.
                    <br><br>
                    Here are some of the games I looked into :
                    <br><br>
                    Pac-Man seemed interesting at first but there would be no clear way to implement a multiplayer feature as the game mainly focuses on single player. Random maps could be generated and the ghost movement could also be random but I decided that it wasn’t the right choice.
                    <br><br>
                    Tetris while fun also had flaws, like Pac-Man the game is single player and while multiplayer elements could be added it would be difficult to make everything work. The shapes dropping in different orders could make the game random but this also wasn’t the best choice.
                    <br><br>
                    After taking all of those factors into consideration I came to the conclusion that pong would be the best overall game to create, the game is relatively simple, it can be played in both single and multiplayer, it would be possible to introduce random elements to the physics of the ball. The game also features a point system and the game ends when the player fails to block the ball.
                    <br><br>
                    After choosing the game, I decided to create a hypothesis putting a twist on the game to make it more interesting for the player. The change I made is the paddle decreasing in size the higher the players score is. This would make the game more difficult for players and the game would become more competitive and tense in multiplayer.

                    After conducting my research and establishing what game I will be making, I set more specifications for the project myself. Upon launch the user will be greeted with a main menu ui, prompted with a couple of options. These options consist of the rest of my specifications, Single player, Multiplayer, Scoreboard and a Quit button. 
                    <br><br>
                    Then I decided to design and code the game in python, more about this will be mentioned in the Implementation.

                    Below is the flowchart I created to help me visualise everything that needs to be accounted for :

                    My project has been designed around the pygame library as it is a powerful and offers several useful tools. I decided to place various parts of the game into separate definitions in order to make it easier to call them at a later point. This opens the option of having multiple game modes for example multiplayer and single player as each segments are stored in separate definitions and loops, meaning they won’t interrupt each other.
                    <br><br>
                    I have used Firebase Realtime Database in my project, it allows me to send data like high scores and player names into a database. These entries are later called on and used to be displayed on scoreboards and calculate useful insights like mean median etc. 
                    <br><br>
                    Using Realtime Database also enables me to feature a scoreboard on the website as all the results are updated in realtime ensuring everything is perfectly in sync.
                    <br><br>
                    Bellow I have provided an algorithm from my game that was crutial to its function : 
                    <br><br>
                    scorelist = []
                    <br><br>
                    ref2 = db.reference('test')<br>
                    snapshot = ref2.order_by_value().limit_to_last(5).get()<br>
                    for key, val in snapshot.items():<br>
                    scorelist.append("{0}".format(key))<br>
                    scorelist.append("{0}".format(val))<br><br>
                    This snippet of code is crucial for the functionality of the database, as the values returned directly from firebase weren’t in a conventional python list meaning specific values can’t be extracted individually using an index.
                    <br><br>
                    The code starts off with the creation of a standard python list.<br>
                    Next we define the location of our firebase database.<br>
                    The next definition uses the location of the database and passes through some more information specifying what we want exactly, in this case we are ordering all the items by value and telling it to get the top 5 results.<br>
                    After that we add a player name (key) and the score (val) to the python list for every key and val in our firebase database.<br>
                    Using this code it is now possible to call a specific index and retrieve specific data from the list.<br><br>
                    The most major issue I’ve faced during this project was implementing the firebase realtime database. The resources online where scarce for implementing it into python. After a lot of research and trail and error I managed to find libraries that offer more or less what I need, after installing them I was faced with the challenge of navigating and setting up the google cloud IAM & admin. Another issue occurred when I was convinced I had to create a new principal in the permission group and grant access manually, as it turned out later a principal was created by firebase and was ready to go.<br>

                    I tested my game every time I added a new feature or line of code to make sure everything is still in order. This also made it easier to troubleshoot it in the future as if the game refused to run or if some sort of issue occurred it’d be easier for me to narrow because I was already working on that section of code.<br><br>
                    The main portion of my code was tested by removing the lines of code that caused the game to end, therefore I was able to run the game continuously and could monitor the results that where being sent to the database.<br><br>

Another method I used consisted of adding print lines in sections that where causing problems so I could narrow down what exactly is causing the issue depending on if the message prints or not <br><br>
