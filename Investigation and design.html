            <p1><br><br>The first step I took in completing this assignment was setting out and researching retro games that would fit the criteria of the project. While researching games I took multiple factors into consideration, the game has to have single player and multiplayer functions, it has to have 3 or more inputs, the game must also have some sort of points system and come to an end, while at the same time being completely random.<br><br>
                Here are some of the games I looked into :<br><br>
                Pac-Man seemed interesting at first but there would be no clear way to implement a multiplayer feature as the game mainly focuses on single player. Random maps could be generated and the ghost movement could also be random but I decided that it wasn’t the right choice.<br><br>
                Tetris while fun also had flaws, like Pac-Man the game is single player and while multiplayer elements could be added it would be difficult to make everything work. The shapes dropping in different orders could make the game random but this also wasn’t the best choice.<br><br>
                After taking all of those factors into consideration I came to the conclusion that pong would be the best overall game to create, the game is relatively simple, it can be played in both single and multiplayer, it would be possible to introduce random elements to the physics of the ball. The game also features a point system and the game ends when the player fails to block the ball.<br><br>
                After choosing the game, I decided to create a hypothesis putting a twist on the game to make it more interesting for the player. The change I made is the paddle decreasing in size the higher the players score is. This would make the game more difficult for players and the game would become more competitive and tense in multiplayer.
